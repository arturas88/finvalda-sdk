# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.11.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **`DocumentType` enum** for the `sDokRusis` header field, with all ten documented codes (`S`, `SF`, `D`, `DS`, `K`, `KS`, `KT`, `VS`, `VD`, `VK`) and Lithuanian labels. `documentType()` on the sale/purchase builders now accepts a `DocumentType` case or a raw 2-character string (fully backward-compatible).

### Documentation
- Documented `series()` / `documentType()` on the purchase example and added a `sDokRusis` code glossary.
- Clarified that document type (`sDokRusis`), series (`sSerija`), and the `save()` parameter (`sParametras`) are three independent inputs, and that `sParametras` selects the journal server-side and cannot be bypassed on create.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed (breaking wire-format corrections)
- **`InternalTransferBuilder` warehouse fields were wrong.** `fromWarehouse()`/`toWarehouse()` emitted `sSandIs`/`sSandI`; the `VidPerkDok` spec requires the header fields **`sIsSandelio`** (source) and **`sISandeli`** (destination), both mandatory. Internal transfers built with this builder were rejected by the server for missing warehouses. The detail rows (`VidPerkDokDetEil`) have no per-line warehouse fields, so `addTransfer()`'s optional `fromWarehouse`/`toWarehouse` arguments now set the header values (last call wins) instead of emitting unrecognized per-line keys.

### Fixed
- **`Data\Client` country code/name collision.** When the API returned only `sValstybe` (country *name*) with no `sValstybeKodas`, that name was copied into both `country` and `countryName`, and `toArray()` then wrote it back into `sValstybeKodas`. `country` no longer falls back to the name key.
- **`ServiceLine::firstMeasurement()` is now respected.** The ×100 second-measurement scaling was applied unconditionally in the constructor, so `firstMeasurement()` still emitted `nKiekis` ×100 instead of the raw quantity (the docs require no scaling for the first measurement). Scaling is now computed at `toArray()` time and skipped when `firstMeasurement()` is set; an explicit `set('nKiekis', …)` always wins. Default behavior (qty 1 → `nKiekis` 100) is unchanged, and fractional quantities now round rather than truncate.

### Documentation
- Documented the service quantity ×100 convention and the difference between `ServiceLine`, `ProductLine`, and the legacy `addService()` helper.
- Documented previously-undocumented methods: the full `Pricing` client/type matrix, `Descriptions` grouping helpers (`clientGroups`, `warehouseGroups`, `logbookGroups`, `opTypeGroups`, `documentSeries`, `calendarEvents`, `vehicles`, `invoiceList`, `reportList`, `typesAndTags`), `References::materiallyResponsiblePersons`/`updateWarehouse`/`updatePaymentTerm`/`addToGroup`, `Transactions::ommPurchasesDetail`/`ommSalesXmlCondition`/`advancedPaymentsDetailExtended`/`depreciationOfFixedAssetsObjects`, `Operations::activityByObjects`, and `Clients::settlementsFromDateParam`.
- Added a note that the legacy `docs/FVS_Webservice.txt` method signatures describe the V0 SOAP interface and don't always match the V2 endpoint (e.g. `GetPrekesSandelyje` uses `sSandKod`, not the documented `sSanKod` — verified against a live server). `Products::inWarehouse()`/`inWarehouseOrdered()` were confirmed correct as-is.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-06-04

### Security
- **Credentials are now redacted from debug capture and PSR-3 logs.** `getLastDebugInfo()['request']['headers']` previously contained the plaintext `Password` (and `ConnString`, which may embed database credentials); both are now replaced with `***`. The `sPassword` query parameter of `GetFvsUser` (`References::user()`) is likewise redacted from the `params` context of the `Finvalda API request` log record. The wire requests are unaffected. Note: `GetFvsUser` inherently places the password in the request URL — documented on `References::user()`.

### Added
- **PSR-3 logging now includes bodies.** The `Finvalda API request` debug record gains a `body` key carrying the full request body as a string (`null` for GET requests; the existing `params` and `has_body` keys are unchanged). The `Finvalda API response` debug record gains a `body` key carrying the full response body. Bodies larger than 100 KB are truncated and suffixed with `... [truncated N bytes]`. Consumers parsing the SDK's log records should expect the new `body` key in both records; no existing keys changed.
- **Laravel: logger and retry are now configurable.** New `config/finvalda.php` keys: `log_channel` (`FINVALDA_LOG_CHANNEL`) routes SDK debug records to a Laravel log channel; `retry.*` (`FINVALDA_RETRY_*`) builds a `RetryPolicy` with exponential backoff. Previously the service provider never wired either, so Laravel apps had no config path to retries or PSR-3 logging.
- **`FinvaldaConfig::fromArray()`**: builds a config (including the retry policy) from the snake_case `config/finvalda.php` array shape; the service provider now delegates to it.

### Fixed
- **`Products::find()` / `Clients::find()` / `Services::find()`** now handle the Pure service's single-entity envelope (`{"Fvs.Preke": {...}}` found / `{"Fvs.Preke": null}` not found). Previously both shapes produced an empty DTO stub (`code = ''`, all fields null): the null-valued wrapper key defeated the `empty()` not-found check, and found entities were never unwrapped before `fromArray()`. `find()` now throws `NotFoundException` when the entity is missing and returns a populated DTO when it exists.
- **`ping()` always returned `false` on servers where `GetFvsUser` responds with XML.** Some server versions ignore the JSON `Accept` header for this endpoint (observed live); `parseResponse()`/`parseOperationResult()` now fall back to XML parsing when the body is not JSON. As part of this, `Response::$error` is normalized to `null` when the server sends an empty error element/string.
- **`AccessDeniedException` now carries the server's explanation** (e.g. `"This function is not licensed in this machine!"`) for operation calls instead of a bare `"Access denied"`.
- **Collections skip malformed rows.** `ProductCollection`/`ClientCollection`/`ServiceCollection::fromArray()` ignore non-array rows instead of throwing a raw `TypeError`.
- **`Pagination\Cursor` silently dropped items.** Deduplication used `spl_object_hash((object) $item)`; for array items the temporary object is freed after each statement, so PHP reuses the address and *different* items collide on the same hash — iteration typically yielded a single item and stopped. Items are now identified via a new optional `idExtractor` constructor callable (e.g. `fn($item) => $item['sKodas']`), defaulting to a content hash (`md5(serialize($item))`) when omitted.

### Fixed (breaking wire-format corrections)
- **ClearingBuilder, ProductionBuilder, NonAnalyticalBuilder, UvmCancellationBuilder** now nest their detail rows **inside** the operation class wrapper (`{"UzskaitaDok": {...header..., "UzskaitaDebitDetEil": [...]}}`), matching the docs XML examples and the official Postman `InsertNewOperation (UzskaitaDok)` body. These builders were added before the v2.4.0 nesting fix and still emitted the pre-2.4.0 sibling shape that the server rejects with `nResult=1037` "Operation do not has detail rows!". `InventoryCountBuilder` was already correct (flat root + `mode`). Note: the `GamybaDok` (production) nesting is inferred from structural consistency — the docs have no XML example for it; verify against a live server if rejected.

### Changed
- Builders with dedicated line arrays (Clearing, Production, NonAnalytical, UvmCancellation, InventoryCount) now throw `BadMethodCallException` from `build()` if generic `addProduct()`/`addService()` lines were added. Previously such lines were silently discarded.
- **`Entity` array writes now throw.** `$product['field'] = ...` and `unset($product['field'])` previously did nothing silently; they now throw `LogicException` (entities are immutable).

## [2.8.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Reports**: `makeInvoicePdf()`, `makeReportPdf()`, `autoReportPdf()` return decoded PDF bytes. `makeInvoice()` / `makeReport()` now accept an array and JSON-encode it for the `sParam` query string.
- **Products::imageJpeg()**: Returns decoded JPG bytes (mirrors the Reports pattern).
- **Concerns\DecodesBinaryResponse** trait shared by Reports and Products.
- **DescriptionType::filterKey()**: Authoritative mapping from type to its wire-format filter key. Most types use the same name, but `CurrentStock`/`BarCodes`/`ProductionItem` → `Products`, `Address` → `Clients`, `DocumentSeries` → `Series`, `CountSales`/`CountClients` → `CountFilter`, `PricesBy*` → `Prices`.

### Fixed (breaking wire-format corrections)
- **Operations::get()** now wraps parameters in a single JSON-encoded `opReadParams` query string per API docs (was sending flat query params, which the server ignored).
- **Descriptions**: convenience methods and `get()` now nest filters under the type's filter key (was flattening into `readParams` top level). Matches docs example `{ readParams: { type: "StockOnDate", StockOnDate: { Date: "..." } } }`.
- **Pricing::recommendedPrice()** now wraps params in `{ inParams: { ... } }` per docs.
- **Clients::email($code)** renamed to **`findByEmail($email)`** and sends `sEMail` query param (was sending `sKliKod` with the client code — server endpoint actually expects email).
- **Operations::changeJournal()** and **copy()** now throw `JsonException` on invalid JSON string input (was silently coercing to null).
- **RetryHandler**: `RetryExhaustedException` is now thrown when all retryable attempts fail (previously unreachable — the original exception was thrown instead, wrapping was dead code). Non-retryable exceptions still propagate unchanged.

### Changed (breaking)
- `DescriptionType::TagsAndTypes` → **`DescriptionType::TypesAndTags`** with wire value `"TypesAndTags"` (API docs example uses `TypesAndTags`; the section heading saying `TagsAndTypes` appears to be a doc error).
- `Descriptions::tagsAndTypes()` → **`typesAndTags()`** to match.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **UvmSalesReservationBuilder** now emits detail rows under `PardDokPrekeDetEil` / `PardDokPaslaugaDetEil` (matching Finvalda's server-side schema for `UVMPardRezDok`). Previously emitted the UVM-prefixed names `UVMPardRezDokPrekeDetEil` / `UVMPardRezDokPaslaugaDetEil`, which Finvalda rejects with `nResult=1037` "Operation do not has detail rows!". `UvmPurchaseOrderBuilder` was already using the non-prefixed `PirkDok...` keys; `UvmCancellationBuilder` uses `UVMAnulDokDetEil` (cancellations have their own schema — verify against the live API if rejected).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **OperationBuilder::build()** now produces the shape Finvalda actually accepts: the operation is wrapped under its class key, with detail-row arrays nested **inside** the wrapper alongside the header fields. Previous versions produced rejected payloads:
  - 2.3.0 (flat, no wrapper) → `{"error":"Xml string is incomplete, missing important information.","nResult":2012}`
  - ≤ 2.2.0 (wrapper + sibling detail arrays) → `{"error":"Operation do not has detail rows!","nResult":1037}`

  Verified against a working non-SDK `PardDok` call. New shape:

  ```json
  {
    "PardDok": {
      "sKlientas": "...",
      "tData": "...",
      "PardDokPrekeDetEil":    [ ... ],
      "PardDokPaslaugaDetEil": [ ... ]
    }
  }
  ```

### Reverted
- The `@deprecated` notice on `OperationBuilder::getHeaderKey()` (added in 2.3.0) — the method is actively used by `build()` again.

### Known limitations (carried over from 2.3.0)
- Subclass overrides of `build()` (`ClearingBuilder`, `ProductionBuilder`, `NonAnalyticalBuilder`, `UvmCancellationBuilder`, `InflowBuilder`, `DisbursementBuilder`) still emit the wrapper-with-sibling-detail-arrays shape (the same pattern that triggers `nResult:1037`). They likely need the same nest-detail-rows-inside-wrapper fix. `InventoryCountBuilder` is unaffected (different shape).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **OperationBuilder::build()** now returns a flat array — header fields at the root with detail-row arrays as siblings — instead of wrapping the header under `getHeaderKey()`. The Pure endpoint identifies the operation class via the `ItemClassName` query parameter, so the JSON body must not contain an outer class wrapper. Previously, `InsertNewOperation` rejected fluent-built UVM sales reservations (and other parent-`build()` operations) with `{"error":"Operation do not has detail rows!","nResult":1037}` because detail-row arrays sat as top-level siblings to the header wrapper instead of alongside the header fields the server expected.

### Changed (Behavior of `build()` output)
- Consumers that read `$builder->build()` directly will see a different shape: instead of `['PardDok' => [...header], 'PardDokPrekeDetEil' => [...]]`, the output is now `['sKlientas' => ..., 'tData' => ..., 'PardDokPrekeDetEil' => [...]]`. Code that calls `->save()` is unaffected.

### Deprecated
- `OperationBuilder::getHeaderKey()` is no longer used by `build()`. It remains in place to preserve subclass contracts.

### Known limitations
- Subclass overrides of `build()` (`ClearingBuilder`, `ProductionBuilder`, `NonAnalyticalBuilder`, `UvmCancellationBuilder`, `InflowBuilder`, `DisbursementBuilder`) still wrap the header under `getHeaderKey()`. If those operations also fail with `nResult:1037`, they need the same flat-shape fix applied to their own `build()` methods. `InventoryCountBuilder` already emits its own non-wrapper shape (`{mode, Inventorizacija}`) and is unaffected.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-09

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **ProductLine DTO**: Fluent value object for building product detail lines with full IDE discoverability — `ProductLine::make('CODE', qty)->warehouse()->amount()->vat()->discount()->object()->objects()->intrastat()->weight()->firstMeasurement()->info()->marked()->set()`
- **ServiceLine DTO**: Fluent value object for service detail lines — `ServiceLine::make('CODE', qty)->amount()->vat()->discount()->object()->objects()->vatCode()->info()->marked()->set()`
- **OperationBuilder::product()**: Accepts `ProductLine` DTOs, adds to product lines array
- **OperationBuilder::service()**: Accepts `ServiceLine` DTOs, adds to service lines array
- Sparse object support on line DTOs: `->object(1, 'DEPT01')->object(4, '1234567')` — levels 2,3,5,6 remain unset
- `set()` escape hatch on both DTOs for raw API fields not covered by named methods

### Changed
- **ProductionBuilder::product()** renamed to **finishedProduct()** to avoid conflict with new `OperationBuilder::product(ProductLine)` method

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-09

### Changed (Breaking)
- **HTTP transport**: All POST write operations now use JSON body instead of form-encoded params, matching the Postman collection's "Json Body" variant
- **GetDescriptions**: Now wraps parameters in `{"readParams":{...}}` envelope and uses lowercase `type` key, matching the documented API format
- **GetOperations (POST)**: Now wraps parameters in `{"opReadParams":{...}}` envelope
- **DeleteItem**: Uses `{"input":{"ItemClassName":"...","Code":"..."}}` JSON body format per Postman spec
- **ChangeJournal**: Now sends flat JSON body (`sJournal`, `nOpNumber`, `sJournalNew`) instead of xmlstring wrapper

### Added
- **HttpClient::postOperationJson()**: New method for endpoints that use flat JSON body and return OperationResult (Lock, Unlock, ChangeJournal, CopyOperation, DeleteItem)

### Fixed
- **GetDescriptions**: Was sending flat params without `readParams` wrapper — API requires the envelope
- **GetOperations POST**: Was sending flat params without `opReadParams` wrapper
- **Descriptions::tagsAndTypes()**: Was bypassing `get()` method, sending wrong format without `readParams` wrapper
- **EditItemProps**: Was sending extra `ItemClassName`/`sKodas` params and missing `Fvs.EditItemProps` wrapper
- **DeleteOperation**: Was sending journal/number as bare params instead of inside xmlstring
- **Clients::invoicesRelatedToCustomer()**: Restored to `post()` with query params matching Postman spec
- Removed `Content-Type: application/json` from default Guzzle headers — Guzzle's `json` option sets it automatically
