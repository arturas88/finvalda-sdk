 * JSON string — around 58 KB for a typical invoice PDF. `InsertDocument` sends
 * one the other way as hex (`inParams.content`), which is twice the file's size. Both sit under
 * BodyTruncator's budget, so both are logged in full, and neither is readable.
 *
 * Lowering the byte budget instead would be the wrong trade: the budget exists
 * to preserve large Get*Set / GetOperations responses, which ARE worth reading.
 * The bytes worth dropping are separable by name, so drop them by name.
