# Finvalda PHP SDK

PHP SDK for the [Finvalda (FVS)](https://www.finvalda.lt/) accounting software web service API.

Built from the official [Finvalda API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7208231/2s8YmRMLvd).

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.3
- Guzzle HTTP client

## Installation

```bash
composer require arturas88/finvalda-sdk
```

## Quick Start

```php
use Finvalda\Finvalda;
use Finvalda\FinvaldaConfig;

// Configure the client
$config = new FinvaldaConfig(
    baseUrl: 'https://your-server.com/FvsServicePure.svc',
    username: 'your-username',
    password: 'your-password',
);

$finvalda = new Finvalda($config);

// Test connection
if (! $finvalda->ping()) {
    die('Connection failed — check credentials and server URL');
}

// Fetch all clients as a typed collection
$clients = $finvalda->clients()->collect();

foreach ($clients as $client) {
    echo "{$client->code}: {$client->name}\n";
}

// Create a sale using the fluent builder
$result = $finvalda->sale()
    ->client('CLI001')
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->warehouse('MAIN')
    ->addProduct('PRD001', quantity: 10, price: 19.99)
    ->addProduct('PRD002', quantity: 5, amount: 49.95)
    ->save('STANDARD');

if ($result->success) {
    echo "Created: {$result->journal} #{$result->number}";
}
```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

```php
use Finvalda\Finvalda;
use Finvalda\FinvaldaConfig;
use Finvalda\Enums\Language;
use Finvalda\Enums\CredentialMode;
use Finvalda\Retry\RetryPolicy;

$config = new FinvaldaConfig(
    baseUrl: 'https://your-server.com/FvsServicePure.svc',
    username: 'your-username',
    password: 'your-password',
    // Optional parameters:
    connString: null,                    // Database connection string
    companyId: null,                     // Company ID for multi-database setups
    language: Language::Lithuanian,      // or Language::English
    removeEmptyStringTags: false,
    removeZeroNumberTags: false,
    removeNewLines: false,
    timeout: 30,
    httpOptions: [],                     // Guzzle request options: verify, proxy, connect_timeout…
    logger: null,                        // PSR-3 logger instance
    retry: null,                         // RetryPolicy instance
    record: false,                              // Keep the last N exchanges in memory
    recordLimit: 20,
    recordCredentials: CredentialMode::Masked,  // or Env (placeholders) / Real
);

$finvalda = new Finvalda($config);
```

### Laravel Integration

The package auto-registers via Laravel package discovery. Add your credentials to `.env`:

```env
FINVALDA_BASE_URL=https://your-server.com/FvsServicePure.svc
FINVALDA_USERNAME=your-username
FINVALDA_PASSWORD=your-password
FINVALDA_COMPANY_ID=your-company-id

# Optional: route SDK debug logs to a Laravel log channel
FINVALDA_LOG_CHANNEL=stack
# Optional: or write to a JSON-lines file instead (FINVALDA_LOG_CHANNEL wins if both are set)
FINVALDA_LOG_PATH=/var/log/finvalda/finvalda.log

# Optional: retry transient failures with exponential backoff
FINVALDA_RETRY_ENABLED=true
FINVALDA_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=3

# Optional: keep the last N request/response exchanges in memory
FINVALDA_RECORD=true
FINVALDA_RECORD_LIMIT=20
FINVALDA_RECORD_CREDENTIALS=masked  # masked | env | real
```

Publish the config file (optional):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=finvalda-config
```

Then inject or use the facade:

```php
// Dependency injection
public function index(Finvalda\Finvalda $finvalda)
{
    $clients = $finvalda->clients()->collect();
}

// Facade
use Finvalda\Laravel\Facades\Finvalda;

$clients = Finvalda::clients()->collect();
```

The container binding is **scoped**: Laravel builds a fresh client per Octane request and
per queue job, so a `record()`, `setLogger()` or company-scoped copy made while handling
one job does not carry into the next. (On a Laravel too old to have `scoped()` it falls
back to a singleton.)

### Company-Scoped Clients

`companyId` sets the `CompanyID` header on every request. Some things are registered
per company — report templates in particular — so an individual call sometimes needs a
different company than the one the client was configured with:

```php
// Render a template that exists only on the default company (no CompanyID header)
// for a document created under this client's company.
$pdf = $finvalda->withoutCompany()->reports()->makeInvoicePdf($params);

// Or target another company explicitly.
$clients = $finvalda->withCompany('HTNT')->clients()->collect();
```

Both return a client that shares this one's transport and observability state —
logger and recorder — so company-scoped calls show up in `recordings()` whether logging
or recording was switched on before or after the company client was created, and turning
either off reaches both. A custom `HttpClient` you injected keeps being used. Repeated
calls for the same company return the same client, so calling this in a loop over one
company is fine — but each *distinct* company you pass is retained for the parent's
lifetime, which matters when the parent is long-lived.

`FinvaldaConfig::withCompanyId()` does the same at the config level.

### Logging

Enable PSR-3 logging for request/response debugging:

```php
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

// Create a logger
$logger = new Logger('finvalda');
$logger->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('path/to/finvalda.log', Logger::DEBUG));

// Option 1: Pass in config
$config = new FinvaldaConfig(
    // ...
    logger: $logger,
);

// Option 2: Set after initialization
$finvalda->setLogger($logger);
```

#### File payloads are elided by default

Report endpoints answer with the whole document base64'd into the response
(~58 KB for a typical invoice PDF), and `documents()->uploadFile()` sends one the
other way as hex, at twice the file's size. Both fit inside the byte budget, so
both used to be logged in full, and neither is readable. They are now replaced
with `"data":"[elided 58000 bytes]"` in log records only:

```php
$config = new FinvaldaConfig(
    // ...
    logFileContents: false,   // default — set true to log payloads verbatim
    logBodyBytes: 100_000,    // byte budget for what is left after eliding
);
```

In Laravel: `FINVALDA_LOG_FILE_CONTENTS=true` and `FINVALDA_LOG_BODY_BYTES`.

Only string values are elided, so a structured `data` array is untouched, and
only values above 512 bytes qualify. **Recording is unaffected** —
`$finvalda->record()` still captures bodies verbatim, because you reach for it
precisely when you need the bytes, and it is bounded and opt-in.

Both records are logged at `debug` level and share a `request_id`. `Finvalda API request` includes method, endpoint, query parameters (`params`; a JSON payload is logged once, as `body`), and the full request body (`body`, string or null for GET). `Finvalda API response` includes method, endpoint, status code, response time, and the full response body (`body`). Bodies larger than 100 KB are truncated with a `... [truncated N bytes]` marker — route the SDK's debug-level records to a suitable handler if log volume is a concern.

#### Logging to a file without a logging framework

`JsonLinesLogger` is a PSR-3 sink that appends one JSON object per line — enough to
grep with `jq`, and no dependency beyond the `psr/log` the SDK already requires:

```php
use Finvalda\Logging\JsonLinesLogger;

$config = new FinvaldaConfig(
    // ...
    logger: new JsonLinesLogger('/var/log/finvalda/finvalda.log'),
);
```

```bash
jq 'select(.status_code >= 400)' /var/log/finvalda/finvalda.log
```

Each entry carries `ts` (ISO 8601, milliseconds, with offset), `pid`, `level` and
`message`, plus the context keys merged in flat; a context key colliding with one of
those four is written prefixed, e.g. `context_message`. The `pid` matters when several
processes append to one file: `LOCK_EX` keeps lines intact but interleaves them, so
group by `pid` rather than by adjacency. Missing directories are created. There is no
rotation (use logrotate), no buffering and no level filter. A failing sink cannot break
an API call: the first failure on each logger instance is reported through the PHP error
log and the rest are silent. Credentials are already redacted before a record reaches
any logger, so the sink does not redact again. The file still holds full request and
response bodies — client names, debts, invoice contents — so it is created `0640`, and
the permissions of a file that already exists are left alone. Place it where only
operators who should see that data can reach it; the directory is yours to lock down.

In Laravel, set `FINVALDA_LOG_PATH=/var/log/finvalda/finvalda.log` instead of
constructing the logger by hand — `FINVALDA_LOG_CHANNEL` takes precedence when both are
set.

### Recording Requests

Recording keeps a short history of exchanges as objects that render themselves —
including failed attempts and each retry. `record(1)` plus `lastRecording()` is the
"what did the last call send and get back" view.

```php
use Finvalda\Enums\CredentialMode;

$finvalda->record();                                    // last 20 exchanges, credentials masked
$finvalda->record(limit: 5);
$finvalda->record(credentials: CredentialMode::Env);    // $FVS_PASSWORD placeholders
$finvalda->record(credentials: CredentialMode::Real);   // real credentials

$finvalda->sale()->client('C001')->save('PARD');

echo $finvalda->lastRecording();                        // formatted HTTP text
echo $finvalda->lastRecording()->toCurl();              // curl command

foreach ($finvalda->recordings() as $exchange) {
    echo $exchange->toCurl(), PHP_EOL;
}

$finvalda->stopRecording();                             // stops and drops the buffer
```

Credential modes:

| Mode | Output | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| `CredentialMode::Masked` (default) | `Password: ***` | Reading recordings, pasting them into an issue |
| `CredentialMode::Env` | `Password: $FVS_PASSWORD` | You want a runnable curl without printing the secret — export the variables first |
| `CredentialMode::Real` | `Password: s3cret` | Local debugging only, never in production |

In Laravel, enable it per environment without touching code:

```env
FINVALDA_RECORD=true
FINVALDA_RECORD_LIMIT=20
FINVALDA_RECORD_CREDENTIALS=masked  # masked | env | real
```

The formatted rendering pretty-prints JSON and expands the payload the API carries in
`xmlstring`, so a write operation is readable at a glance:

```
POST https://your-server.com/FvsServicePure.svc/InsertNewOperation
UserName: demo
Password: ***
Accept: application/json
Language: 0

{
    "ItemClassName": "PardDok",
    "sParametras": "PARD",
    "xmlstring": {
        "PardDok": {
            "sKlientas": "C001"
        }
    }
}

--- 200 OK (128.4 ms) ---
{
    "AccessResult": "Success",
    "nResult": 0
}
```

`toCurl()` keeps the body exactly as sent, so the command reproduces the call:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://your-server.com/FvsServicePure.svc/InsertNewOperation' \
  -H 'UserName: demo' \
  -H 'Password: ***' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Language: 0' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"ItemClassName":"PardDok","sParametras":"PARD","xmlstring":"{\"PardDok\":{\"sKlientas\":\"C001\"}}"}'
```

Under `CredentialMode::Env` the quoting is placeholder-aware, so the command runs as-is once
the variables are exported and the secret never appears in the output:

```bash
export FVS_PASSWORD='your-password'

curl -X POST 'https://your-server.com/FvsServicePure.svc/InsertNewOperation' \
  -H 'UserName: demo' \
  -H 'Password: '"$FVS_PASSWORD" \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Language: 0' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"ItemClassName":"PardDok","sParametras":"PARD","xmlstring":"{\"PardDok\":{\"sKlientas\":\"C001\"}}"}'
```

The placeholders are `$FVS_PASSWORD` (the `Password` header), `$FVS_CONN_STRING` (the
`ConnString` header), and `$FVS_SPASSWORD` (the `sPassword` query parameter that
`$finvalda->references()->user()` sends to `GetFvsUser` — a different secret from the
connection password, which is why it gets its own name). The SDK only emits them — it never
reads them from the environment.

Each `Exchange` exposes `method`, `url`, `headers`, `body`, `statusCode`, `reasonPhrase`,
`responseHeaders`, `responseBody`, `durationMs`, `error`, and `attempt`, plus `toString()`,
`toCurl()`, `toArray()`, and `withCredentials()`.

Worth knowing:

- **Credentials are substituted as the exchange is recorded**, unless you choose
  `CredentialMode::Real`. Two mechanisms, with different guarantees:
  - **By key** — the `Password`, `ConnString` and `sPassword` entries in the request headers,
    the URL query and a JSON request body, plus a userinfo password in the URL. This is exact.
  - **By value** — the credential values the SDK knows about are then removed from the error
    message, the response headers and the response body, together with their percent-encoded
    and JSON-escaped forms. This is needed because Guzzle embeds the encoded request URI in
    its exception messages and a server can echo a credential back.

  What that does *not* guarantee: value scrubbing only covers credentials the SDK saw, so a
  secret it never handled (a token inside your own payload, a credential the server invents)
  is recorded as-is, and a credential carried only inside a request body larger than the
  recording cap cannot be substituted by key. It is also literal and blind to context, so a
  credential value that legitimately appears as data elsewhere gets masked too — and with a
  very short credential value that collateral damage is severe (a one-character password
  rewrites every occurrence of that character, which under `Env` mode can even mangle the
  placeholders it just inserted). Treat a recording as a redacted debugging aid, not as a
  sanitised artefact safe to publish unread.

  A masked curl needs the real value substituted before it runs; an `Env` curl just needs the
  variables exported.
- **PSR-3 logging always masks**, whatever the recording mode is set to.
- **`Content-Type: application/json` in curl output is inferred.** Guzzle adds it for JSON
  bodies; the SDK does not set it itself.
- **Recordings are the SDK's view of the request.** The recorded URL is the absolute URL the
  SDK hands Guzzle, and the body reproduces Guzzle's own encoding (RFC 3986 query encoding,
  the same JSON encoding Guzzle applies to the `json` option), but if you inject your own
  Guzzle client with extra default headers or middleware, those additions are not reflected.
- **Each call carries a `requestId`**, shared by all its retry attempts and by its two log
  records (`request_id`), so a recording can be matched to its log lines.
- **Failures are recorded, then rethrown.** A 4xx/5xx exchange carries the status and error
  body; a connection failure carries `error` with no status.
- **Retries record one exchange per attempt**, each with its own `attempt` number and duration.
- **Bodies are capped at 100 KB each**, the same budget PSR-3 logging uses, with the excess
  replaced by a `... [truncated N bytes]` marker. Without the cap a long-lived process (a
  client you keep in a static or a long-running script keeps one buffer for its lifetime) would
  retain `limit` whole bodies — and `Reports` endpoints answer with PDFs. A truncated body
  makes `toCurl()` non-reproducible for that exchange: the `-d` payload is no longer the
  bytes that were sent. Keep `limit` modest in long-running processes.
- **`FINVALDA_RECORD_LIMIT=0` records one exchange, not none** — the limit is clamped to a
  minimum of 1. Set `FINVALDA_RECORD=false` (or call `stopRecording()`) to disable recording.

### Retry Policy

Configure automatic retries for transient failures. **Only reads are retried.** Writes
(`InsertNewOperation`, `EditItem`, `DeleteOperation`, …) are sent once whatever the
policy: a timeout after the request went out may mean the server already committed the
operation, and a second attempt would post it twice. After the last attempt the
original exception is thrown (`NetworkException`, `ServerException`, `HttpException`),
exactly as without a policy.

```php
use Finvalda\Retry\RetryPolicy;

// Default retry policy (3 attempts, 100ms initial delay, exponential backoff)
$config = new FinvaldaConfig(
    // ...
    retry: RetryPolicy::default(),
);

// Custom retry policy
$config = new FinvaldaConfig(
    // ...
    retry: new RetryPolicy(
        maxAttempts: 5,
        delayMs: 200,
        multiplier: 2.0,
        maxDelayMs: 10000,
        retryableStatusCodes: [429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
        retryOnNetworkError: true,
    ),
);

// Conservative policy (longer delays)
$config = new FinvaldaConfig(
    // ...
    retry: RetryPolicy::conservative(),
);

// Disable retries
$config = new FinvaldaConfig(
    // ...
    retry: RetryPolicy::noRetry(),
);
```

### Custom HTTP Client (Testing)

For TLS, proxy or connection settings you do not need your own client — pass Guzzle
request options through the config:

```php
$config = new FinvaldaConfig(
    // ...
    httpOptions: [
        'verify' => '/etc/ssl/finvalda.pem',   // CA bundle for a self-signed server
        'proxy' => 'http://proxy:3128',
        'connect_timeout' => 5,
    ],
);
```

In Laravel, set `http_options` in the published `config/finvalda.php`.

Inject a custom Guzzle client for testing or custom middleware. The SDK requests absolute
URLs built from `baseUrl` and applies `timeout` and `httpOptions` per request, so the client
needs no `base_uri` of its own:

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use GuzzleHttp\Handler\MockHandler;
use GuzzleHttp\HandlerStack;
use GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Response;

$mock = new MockHandler([
    new Response(200, [], json_encode(['AccessResult' => 'Success', 'items' => []])),
]);

$httpClient = new \Finvalda\HttpClient($config, new Client(['handler' => HandlerStack::create($mock)]));
$finvalda = new Finvalda($config, $httpClient);
```

## Typed DTOs & Collections

The SDK provides typed Data Transfer Objects for better IDE support and type safety.

### Finding Entities

Use `find()` to get a single entity as a typed DTO with full IDE autocomplete:

```php
use Finvalda\Data\Client;
use Finvalda\Data\Product;
use Finvalda\Data\Service;
use Finvalda\Exceptions\FinvaldaException;
use Finvalda\Exceptions\NotFoundException;

// Find a client - returns typed Client DTO
$client = $finvalda->clients()->find('CLI001');
echo $client->name;           // Full IDE autocomplete
echo $client->email;
echo $client->vatCode;
echo $client->debt;

// Find a product
$product = $finvalda->products()->find('PRD001');
echo $product->name;
echo $product->price1;
echo $product->barcode;
echo $product->supplier1;

// Find a service
$service = $finvalda->services()->find('SVC001');
echo $service->name;
echo $service->price;

// Handle not found. A failed request is NOT "not found": find(), collect()
// and typesAndTags() throw FinvaldaException for it, so an outage can never
// look like an empty result set.
try {
    $client = $finvalda->clients()->find('NONEXISTENT');
} catch (NotFoundException $e) {
    echo "Client not found";
} catch (FinvaldaException $e) {
    echo "Request failed: {$e->getMessage()}";
}

// Access raw API data if needed
$rawData = $client->raw;
$specificField = $client['sSpecialField']; // ArrayAccess supported
```

### Working with Collections

Use `collect()` to get typed collections with powerful filtering and transformation methods:

```php
use Finvalda\Collections\ClientCollection;
use Finvalda\Collections\ProductCollection;

// Get all clients as a typed collection
$clients = $finvalda->clients()->collect();

// Filter clients with debt
$debtors = $clients->withDebt();
$totalDebt = $clients->totalDebt();

// Filter by type
$vipClients = $clients->whereType('VIP');

// Find by code within collection
$client = $clients->findByCode('CLI001');

// Get products
$products = $finvalda->products()->collect();

// Filter by type
$electronics = $products->whereType('ELECTRONICS');

// Filter by supplier
$fromSupplier = $products->whereSupplier('SUP001');

// Products with stock
$inStock = $products->withStock();

// Filter by tag
$tagged = $products->whereTag(1, 'FEATURED');

// Find by barcode
$product = $products->findByBarcode('1234567890123');

// Collection methods work on all collections
$clients->count();                    // Count items
$clients->isEmpty();                  // Check if empty
$clients->isNotEmpty();               // Check if not empty
$clients->first();                    // Get first item
$clients->last();                     // Get last item
$clients->get(5);                     // Get by index
$clients->all();                      // Get as array

// Filtering and mapping
$filtered = $clients->filter(fn($c) => $c->debt > 1000);
$names = $clients->map(fn($c) => $c->name);
$codes = $clients->pluck('code');

// Iteration
foreach ($clients as $client) {
    echo "{$client->code}: {$client->name}\n";
}

// Execute callback for each
$clients->each(function($client) {
    sendReminder($client);
});

// Group by field
$byType = $clients->groupBy(fn($c) => $c->type);
foreach ($byType as $type => $typeClients) {
    echo "{$type}: {$typeClients->count()} clients\n";
}

// Convert to array
$array = $clients->toArray();

// Date filtering
$recentClients = $finvalda->clients()->collect(modifiedSince: '2024-01-01');
$newProducts = $finvalda->products()->collect(createdSince: '2024-06-01');
```

## Fluent Operation Builders

Create operations using an intuitive fluent interface instead of complex nested arrays.

### Creating a Sale

```php
// Fluent builder (new way)
$result = $finvalda->sale()
    ->client('CLI001')
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->warehouse('MAIN')                 // default sSandelis for every product line
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->note('January order')
    ->documentNumber('ORD-2024-001')
    ->dueDate('2024-02-14')             // tMokejimoData
    ->discount(5.0)
    ->object1('DEPT01')
    ->object2('PROJ01')
    ->employee('JONAS')
    ->exportToIvaz()
    ->roundingAmount(0.01)
    ->addProduct('PRD001', quantity: 10, amount: 199.90, price: 19.99)
    ->addProduct('PRD002', quantity: 5, amount: 49.95)
    ->addService('SVC001', quantity: 200, amount: 100.00)
    ->save('STANDARD');

// Equivalent array-based approach (old way - still supported)
$result = $finvalda->operations()->create(OperationClass::Sale, [
    'PardDok' => [
        'sKlientas' => 'CLI001',
        'tData' => '2024-01-15',
        'sValiuta' => 'EUR',
        'sPastaba' => 'January order',
        'sDokumentas' => 'ORD-2024-001',
        'tMokejimoData' => '2024-02-14',
        'dNuolaida' => 5.0,
        'sObjektas1' => 'DEPT01',
        'sObjektas2' => 'PROJ01',
        'PardDokPrekeDetEil' => [
            ['sKodas' => 'PRD001', 'nKiekis' => 10, 'nPirmasMat' => 1, 'sSandelis' => 'MAIN', 'dSumaV' => 199.90, 'dSumaVntV' => 19.99],
            ['sKodas' => 'PRD002', 'nKiekis' => 5, 'nPirmasMat' => 1, 'sSandelis' => 'MAIN', 'dSumaV' => 49.95],
        ],
        'PardDokPaslaugaDetEil' => [
            ['sKodas' => 'SVC001', 'nKiekis' => 200, 'dSumaV' => 100.00],
        ],
    ],
], 'STANDARD');
```

Every setter writes a field the spec defines for that operation's envelope — a
builder offers no setter for a field its envelope lacks, because the server silently
drops unknown fields. Where a mistake can only be seen at `build()` (a header field
on a `short()` variant, a unit price on a purchase line), `build()` throws
`ValidationException` instead of sending a payload that would quietly lose data.
`tests/Spec/BuilderSpecConformanceTest.php` checks every setter against the spec
tables in `docs/FVS_Webservice.md`.

> **Unit price (`price`) is sales-only.** It writes `dSumaVntV`/`dSumaVntL` (unit
> price without VAT and discount); purchase detail lines have no unit-price field,
> so purchases take `amount` (`dSumaV`) only.

### Using Line DTOs (Recommended for Accounting)

For operations that need VAT, amounts in EUR, objects per line, or other detail fields, use `ProductLine` and `ServiceLine` DTOs for full IDE discoverability:

```php
use Finvalda\Builders\ProductLine;
use Finvalda\Builders\ServiceLine;

$result = $finvalda->sale()
    ->client('CLI001')
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->series('SF')
    ->employee('JONAS')
    ->product(
        ProductLine::make('MILTAI', 12.25)
            ->warehouse('CENTR.')
            ->amount(161.16, local: 161.16)
            ->vat(percent: 21, amount: 33.84, amountLocal: 33.84)
    )
    ->product(
        ProductLine::make('PIENAS', 5)
            ->warehouse('CENTR.')
            ->price(5.00)
            ->vat(percent: 21)
            ->discount(percent: 5.0)
            ->object(1, 'DEPT01')
            ->object(4, '1234567')        // sparse objects — level 2,3 skipped
    )
    ->service(
        ServiceLine::make('TRANSPORT', 1)
            ->amount(50.00, local: 50.00)
            ->vat(percent: 21, amount: 10.50, amountLocal: 10.50)
            ->object(1, 'DEPT01')
    )
    ->save('STANDARD');
```

The `product()` / `service()` methods accept line DTOs. The existing `addProduct()` / `addService()` / `addProductLine()` / `addServiceLine()` methods still work — you can mix both styles in the same builder.

**Available ProductLine methods:** `price()` (sales only), `amount()`, `vat()`, `discount()`, `warehouse()`, `object()`, `objects()`, `additionalCost()`/`additionalCosts()` (purchases only), `vatCode()`, `intrastat()`, `weight()`, `firstMeasurement()`, `secondMeasurement()`, `info()` (sales only), `marked()`, `set()`

**Available ServiceLine methods:** `price()` (sales only), `amount()`, `vat()`, `discount()`, `object()`, `objects()`, `vatCode()`, `description()` (sales only), `firstMeasurement()`, `info()` (sales only), `marked()`, `set()`

`object()`/`objects()` accept levels 1-6 and throw `ValidationException` otherwise.
A line DTO cannot see which operation it will join, so a sales-only or purchase-only
field is rejected by the receiving builder's `build()`.

#### Quantity convention (important)

Every product/service code (`sKodas`) is configured in Finvalda with a measurement
unit that has **two dimensions** — a *first* (primary) unit, a *second* unit, and a
**first/second ratio** (`pirm_antr_sant`, from `references()->measurementUnits()`).
Examples: `M` → first = m, second = cm, ratio 100; `KG` → first = kg, second = g,
ratio 1000; `VNT` → ratio 1. The `nPirmasMat` flag selects which dimension `nKiekis`
is read in:

| `nPirmasMat` | How Finvalda reads `nKiekis` |
|---|---|
| `1` (sent) | In the **first (primary)** unit, **verbatim**. `250` on an "M" product = 250 m. |
| absent | In the **second** unit, then **rescaled by the unit's ratio**. `250` on an "M" product = 250 cm = **2.5 m**. |

The second-measurement default is **not a no-op** — Finvalda divides by the ratio.
`VNT` products (ratio 1) are unaffected, which is why piece quantities never exposed
this. All official Finvalda API examples send product lines with `"nPirmasMat":"1"`.

Services additionally use a **×100 fixed-point** encoding for the second measurement
(`1 → 100`, `0.5 → 50`); products do not. From the spec:

> **Service** `nKiekis` — *paslaugos kiekis antru matavimu (integer) arba pirmu jei nurodyta nPirmasMat=1. **Kiekis padaugintas iš 100.** Jeigu reikalingas kiekis 0.5 tada nKiekis = 50, jeigu reikalingas kiekis 1 tada nKiekis = 100. Jeigu naudojamas pirmas matavimas dauginti nereikia.*
>
> **Product** `nKiekis` — *prekės kiekis antru matavimu (integer) arba pirmu jei nurodyta nPirmasMat=1.* (no ×100)

##### What the SDK does for you

| Builder helper | Default | Opt-out |
|---|---|---|
| `ProductLine::make($code, $qty)` | **First measurement**: emits `nKiekis = $qty` verbatim and `nPirmasMat = 1` | `->secondMeasurement()` (or `->firstMeasurement(false)`) drops `nPirmasMat` so Finvalda rescales by the unit ratio |
| `ServiceLine::make($code, $qty)` | **Second measurement**: emits `nKiekis = round($qty × 100)` | `->firstMeasurement()` emits `nKiekis = $qty` as-is and `nPirmasMat = 1` |
| `addProduct()` | Emits `nKiekis` **verbatim** and `nPirmasMat = 1` | Pass `additionalData: ['nPirmasMat' => 0]`, or use `addProductLine()` for raw control |
| `addService()` | Emits `nKiekis` **verbatim** (no scaling, no `nPirmasMat`) | Pass `nPirmasMat` via `additionalData` |
| `addProductLine()` / `addServiceLine()` | Emit the line array **verbatim** (no defaults) | — |

> **Why product lines default to `nPirmasMat=1`:** real quantities are expressed in the
> primary unit (you book "250 metres", not "25000 cm"). Omitting the flag silently
> divided M/KG quantities by their ratio. Both `ProductLine::make()` and the
> `addProduct()` helper default to the primary unit; `addProductLine()` stays a raw
> passthrough for full control.

```php
// Product (default, first measurement): qty sent verbatim in the primary unit
$finvalda->sale()->client('CLI001')->product(
    ProductLine::make('1141817', 250.0)        // nKiekis = 250, nPirmasMat = 1 → 250 m
)->save('STANDARD');

// Product, second measurement: Finvalda rescales by the unit ratio (rarely what you want)
$finvalda->sale()->client('CLI001')->product(
    ProductLine::make('1141817', 250.0)->secondMeasurement()  // nKiekis = 250 → 2.5 m on an "M" product
)->save('STANDARD');

// Service, second measurement (default): qty 1 → nKiekis 100, 0.5 → 50
$finvalda->sale()->client('CLI001')->service(
    ServiceLine::make('TRANSPORT', 0.5)        // nKiekis = 50
)->save('STANDARD');

// Service, first measurement: qty sent as-is
$finvalda->sale()->client('CLI001')->service(
    ServiceLine::make('TRANSPORT', 1)->firstMeasurement()   // nKiekis = 1, nPirmasMat = 1
)->save('STANDARD');
```

For rare/niche API fields not covered by named methods, use the `set()` escape hatch:

```php
ProductLine::make('SPECIAL', 1)
    ->warehouse('CENTR.')
    ->vat(percent: 21)
    ->set('sAtitSer', 'CERT-001')     // conformity certificate
    ->set('tGalData', '2025-12-31')   // expiry date
```

### Creating a Purchase

```php
use Finvalda\Enums\DocumentType;

$result = $finvalda->purchase()
    ->client('SUP001')
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->warehouse('MAIN')
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->documentNumber('INV-2024-001')         // sDokumentas — the supplier's invoice number
    ->documentType(DocumentType::VatInvoice) // sDokRusis — or pass 'SF'
    ->dueDate('2024-03-14')                  // tMokejimoData
    ->addProduct('PRD001', quantity: 100, amount: 999.00)
    ->addProduct('PRD002', quantity: 50, amount: 749.50)
    ->addService('FREIGHT', quantity: 100, amount: 150.00)
    ->save('STANDARD');
```

The full purchase header (`PirkDok`) has **no series field**: `series()` is accepted
on `->short()` purchases only, and a full purchase with a series fails at `build()`.

#### Document type, series & the operation parameter

`series()`, `documentType()`, and the `save()` parameter are **three independent
inputs** to a create call — none of them is derived from the others:

| Builder method | API field | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| `documentType()` | `sDokRusis` | The document type (see codes below) |
| `series()` | `sSerija` | The document series |
| `save('STANDARD')` | `sParametras` | The server-configured import/journal profile |

`documentType()` accepts a `DocumentType` enum case or a raw 2-character code:

| Code | `DocumentType` case | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `S`  | `Invoice` | Sąskaita faktūra |
| `SF` | `VatInvoice` | PVM sąskaita faktūra |
| `D`  | `DebitInvoice` | Debetinė sąskaita |
| `DS` | `DebitVatInvoice` | Debetinė PVM sąskaita |
| `K`  | `CreditInvoice` | Kreditinė sąskaita |
| `KS` | `CreditVatInvoice` | Kreditinė PVM sąskaita faktūra |
| `KT` | `Other` | Kita |
| `VS` | `LawyerVatInvoice` | Advokatų PVM sąskaita faktūra |
| `VD` | `LawyerVatInvoiceDebit` | Advokatų PVM sąskaita faktūra debetinė |
| `VK` | `LawyerVatInvoiceCredit` | Advokatų PVM sąskaita faktūra kreditinė |

These methods are available on `sale()`, `salesReservation()`, `salesReturn()`,
`uvmSalesReservation()`, `purchase()`, `purchaseOrder()`, `purchaseReturn()` and
`uvmPurchaseOrder()` (`series()` on purchases: `short()` only).

> **`sParametras` is required and cannot be bypassed.** The operation *type*
> (purchase vs. sale, i.e. `ItemClassName`) is what you pick by choosing the
> builder, and you set `sDokRusis`/`sSerija` yourself — but the journal an
> operation lands in is resolved server-side from the `sParametras` profile you
> pass to `save()`. There is no header field to specify the journal directly on
> create; the resulting journal/number come back on the `OperationResult`.

### Additional Purchase Costs

A purchase header can declare up to four **additional-cost buckets** (*papildomos
išlaidos*) — named categories such as freight, registration or insurance — whose
amounts are then allocated per product line. The two halves are one feature: bucket
codes without per-line amounts book nothing, and per-line amounts without bucket
codes have nowhere to land.

```php
$finvalda->purchase()
    ->client('SUP001')
    ->date('2026-07-28')
    ->warehouse('WH01')
    ->documentNumber('INV-2026-0042')
    ->additionalCostCodes(['KITOS', 'TRANSP', 'ILGALSAV', 'DRAUDIM'])  // slots 1-4
    ->product(
        ProductLine::make('WSM000001TB061527', 1)
            ->warehouse('WH01')
            ->amount(38_500.00)
            ->additionalCost(2, 950.00)              // TRANSP  → dPapIsldSumaV2/L2
            ->additionalCosts([4 => 310.00])         // DRAUDIM → dPapIsldSumaV4/L4
    )
    ->save('PIRKNAU');
```

| Method | API fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `additionalCostCodes([...])` | `sPapIslaiduKodas1..4` | Ordered list fills slots 1-4 in order; a slot-keyed map (`[2 => 'TRANSP']`) sets individual slots. Max 4 codes, 10 chars each. |
| `ProductLine::additionalCost($slot, $currency, $local)` | `dPapIsldSumaV{slot}`, `dPapIsldSumaL{slot}` | Always writes both the currency and EUR halves; `$local` defaults to `$currency`. |
| `ProductLine::additionalCosts([$slot => $amount])` | same | Plural convenience, keyed by slot. |

> **The slot *number* is the binding.** Slot 2 in the header is what slot 2 on the
> line allocates to. Slots are positional and server-configured — do not reorder
> them between bookings of the same journal, or previously booked allocations stop
> lining up with their buckets.

Availability follows the spec exactly:

- Cost codes exist on **`purchase()` and `purchaseOrder()` only** (*Tik PirkDok ir
  PirkUzsDok*). `purchaseReturn()` has no such method.
- They are **not** available on `->short()` — `TrumpasPirkDok` has no
  additional-cost fields. Since `short()` may be called after
  `additionalCostCodes()`, that conflict is reported by `build()`/`save()`.
- Per-line amounts are **product lines only** (*Tik PirkDokPrekeDetEil*).
  `ServiceLine` has no `additionalCost()`, because service detail rows do not
  define the fields.

The SDK does not round the amounts (the fields are `Numeric(14,2)`) and cannot
check that the header actually declares a code in the slot you allocate to — the
line object cannot see the header.

### Correcting a Purchase

`purchaseUpdate()` builds the `KoregPirkDok` envelope for `UpdateOperation`.

> ### ⚠️ A correction is destructive, not an edit
>
> `KoregPirkDok` corrects an operation by **deleting** the named detail lines and
> **re-adding** the ones you supply. Re-adding a product line **rebuilds that
> product's FIFO stock layer**, and the internal delete fails outright once the
> goods have been consumed by another operation — a sale, write-off, transfer or
> production run. The error is **`4027` — *Operacijos detalios eilutės yra
> panaudotos kitose operacijose!*** Note it is documented under operation
> *deletion* errors, not the `5000`–`5005` correction family, so an **update** call
> can return a **deletion**-class code.
>
> Three things worth knowing before you ship a caller:
>
> 1. **It is not idempotent.** A re-added line is a new acquisition with a new cost
>    layer. Re-sending the same correction is not a no-op.
> 2. **It fails late.** Unsold stock corrects fine; the same code path starts
>    failing the day someone sells the goods.
> 3. **Do not rely on partial success.** If a multi-line correction rejects on one
>    consumed line, re-read the operation before retrying.
>
> Check `Stock::purchaseOpFor($code)['sold']` first, or call `assertNotSold()`.
> `UpdPrekeDetEil` is **not** an escape hatch: the spec gives it only `sKodas`,
> `nKodasN`, `nPozymis` and `sPapInfo`, so it can flip a line's marked flag and free
> text but cannot restate amounts. There is no way to re-allocate costs without the
> delete/re-add cycle.

```php
$stock = $finvalda->stock()->purchaseOpFor('WSM000001TB061527');

if ($stock === null || $stock['sold']) {
    // Sold, or never purchased. A correction here would hit 4027, or rebuild a
    // stock layer underneath a sale. Report it; let an accountant handle it.
    return;
}

$finvalda->purchaseUpdate()
    ->journal($stock['journal'])
    ->number($stock['op_number'])
    ->additionalCostCodes([2 => 'TRANSP'])
    ->removeProduct('WSM000001TB061527', $stock['warehouse'])
    ->product(
        ProductLine::make('WSM000001TB061527', 1)
            ->warehouse($stock['warehouse'])
            ->amount(38_500.00)
            ->vat(percent: 21, amount: 8_085.00)
            ->additionalCost(2, 1_270.00)   // was 950.00
    )
    ->save('PIRKNAU');
```

This emits the documented envelope — note that it is **not** the insert envelope:

```json
{
  "KoregPirkDok": {
    "sZurnalas": "PIRKNAU",
    "nNumeris": 1421,
    "PirkDokHeadEil": { "sPapIslaiduKodas2": "TRANSP" },
    "DelPrekeDetEil": [ { "sKodas": "WSM000001TB061527", "sSandelis": "WH01" } ],
    "PirkDokPrekeDetEil": [ { "sKodas": "WSM000001TB061527", "...": "..." } ]
  }
}
```

| Method | Node | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `journal()` / `number()` | `sZurnalas`, `nNumeris` | Both required — they identify the operation to correct. |
| `header([...])` | `PirkDokHeadEil` | Raw field names, merged across calls, validated against the documented column set. Omit to leave the header alone. |
| `additionalCostCodes([...])` | `PirkDokHeadEil` | Same method as on insert (*Tik KoregPirkDok ir KoregPirkUzsDok*). |
| `removeProduct($code, $warehouse)` | `DelPrekeDetEil` | Warehouse optional. |
| `removeService($code)` | `DelPaslaugaDetEil` | |
| `product(ProductLine)` | `PirkDokPrekeDetEil` | Requires `sKodas`, `sSandelis`, `dSumaV`, `dSumaL`, `nKiekis`. Rejects fields the correction table lacks (VAT percent, objects, intrastat, weights, `sPapInf`). |
| `service(ServiceLine)` | `PirkDokPaslaugaDetEil` | Requires `sKodas`, `dSumaV`, `dSumaL`, `nKiekis`. Same rejection rule. |
| `assertNotSold()` | — | One `purchaseOpFor()` round trip per distinct product code; throws `ConflictException` when a touched product is sold. |

What `header()` deliberately **refuses**, because `PirkDokHeadEil` does not accept
it for a purchase:

- **`sKlientas`** — a purchase correction cannot change the supplier (*Tik
  KoregPardDok ir KoregPardRezDok*).
- **Any operation date** — the node defines none, neither `tData` nor
  `tTiekejoSFData`. The operation date is not correctable here.
- **`sObjektas5` / `sObjektas6`** — the node stops at `sObjektas4`.
- **Waybill (*važtaraštis*) fields** — documented for sales, sales reservations and
  purchase returns only.

`assertNotSold()` **fails closed**: a product whose purchase history cannot be
resolved is refused too, since a guard on a destructive call must not pass just
because the lookup failed. It is deliberately *not* run by `save()` — it costs a
round trip per code and hides a decision the caller should be making.

Only purchases are covered. The other six `UpdateOperationClass` cases share the
envelope shape but each has its own `Tik ...` annotations; use
`operations()->update()` with a hand-built payload for those.

### Creating an Internal Transfer

```php
$result = $finvalda->internalTransfer()
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->fromWarehouse('MAIN')      // header field sIsSandelio
    ->toWarehouse('BRANCH')      // header field sISandeli
    ->name('Restock branch warehouse')
    ->addTransfer('PRD001', quantity: 50)
    ->addTransfer('PRD002', quantity: 25)
    ->save('TRANSFER');
```

An internal transfer carries a **single** source/destination warehouse pair at the
header level — the detail rows have no per-line warehouse fields. To move stock
between different warehouse pairs, create separate transfer operations.
`addTransfer()`'s `fromWarehouse`/`toWarehouse` arguments set that pair; one that
contradicts a warehouse already set throws `ValidationException` rather than
re-routing the earlier lines. Generic `product()`/`addProduct()` lines are rejected —
`VidPerkDokDetEil` has no amounts, VAT or warehouse.

### Creating Returns

```php
// Sales return
$result = $finvalda->salesReturn()
    ->short()
    ->client('CLI001')
    ->date('2024-01-20')
    ->documentNumber('GRAZ-001')
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->warehouse('MAIN')
    ->addProduct('PRD001', quantity: 2, amount: 39.98)
    ->save('RETURN');

// Purchase return
$result = $finvalda->purchaseReturn()
    ->client('SUP001')
    ->date('2024-01-20')
    ->documentNumber('GRAZ-002')
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->warehouse('MAIN')
    ->addProduct('PRD001', quantity: 10, amount: 99.90)
    ->save('RETURN');
```

> **Note:** In live testing the full `PardGrazDok` variant was rejected with error
> 2012 ("Xml string is incomplete") even with a spec-correct payload, while the
> same fields via `->short()` (`TrumpasPardGrazDok`) succeeded. If a full-variant

> `originalDocument()` / `reason()` setters wrote invented fields (`sGrazDokumentas`,
> `sGrazZurnalas`, `nGrazNumeris`, `sGrazPriezastis`) that the server dropped, and
> were removed.

### Creating Payments

```php
use Finvalda\Enums\PaymentType;

// Payment received (inflow, IplDok) settling a specific sale
$result = $finvalda->inflow()
    ->client('CLI001')
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->documentNumber('KPO-001')
    ->type(PaymentType::Documents)           // nTipas 3
    ->name('Payment for invoice SF-001')
    ->forDocument('SF', '001', 500.00)       // series, document, amount
    ->save('INFLOW');

// Payment out (disbursement, IsmDok) as an advance
$result = $finvalda->disbursement()
    ->client('SUP001')
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->documentNumber('KIO-001')
    ->type(PaymentType::Advance)             // nTipas 0
    ->addLine(1000.00, 'Advance for PO-001')
    ->save('DISBURSEMENT');
```

`PaymentType`: `Advance` (0), `Fifo` (1, settles the client's open documents
oldest-first) and `Documents` (3, settles the documents named on the lines). The
payment total is the sum of the lines' `dSumaV`; the header has no amount field.
Lines are nested inside the `IplDok`/`IsmDok` wrapper like every other operation.

> **Disbursements are unverified live.** The spec documents the `IsmDok` envelope
> (in the shared "IplDok, IsmDok" table) but leaves it out of the InsertNewOperation
> class list. The `Mokejimas` payment-order node is not supported.

### Builder Advanced Usage

```php
// Set the parameter once
$sale = $finvalda->sale()->parameter('STANDARD');

// Add custom header fields
$sale->setHeader('sCustomField', 'value');

// Add product lines with additional spec fields
$sale->addProduct('PRD001', quantity: 10, amount: 199.90, warehouse: 'WH01', additionalData: [
    'sPapInf' => 'LOT001',
    'tIvykdymoData' => '2025-12-31',
]);

// Add raw product line
$sale->addProductLine([
    'sKodas' => 'PRD002',
    'nKiekis' => 5,
    'nPirmasMat' => 1,
    'dSumaV' => 149.95,
    'sSandelis' => 'WH01',
]);

// Build without saving (for inspection)
$data = $sale->build();
print_r($data);

// Save
$result = $sale->save();
```

### Write-Offs & Capitalization

```php
// Write-off (disposal of inventory)
$result = $finvalda->writeOff()
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->name('Monthly write-off')
    ->note('Damaged goods')
    ->employee('Jonas')
    ->warehouse('MAIN')                  // default sSandelis for every line
    ->addItem('PRD001', quantity: 5, account: '6110')
    ->addItem('PRD002', quantity: 3, account: '6110')
    ->save('WRITEOFF');

// Capitalization (receiving inventory)
$result = $finvalda->capitalization()
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->name('Inventory receiving')
    ->addItem('PRD001', quantity: 10, amount: 199.90, warehouse: 'MAIN', account: '2010')
    ->save('CAPITALIZE');
```

Write-off, capitalization, transfer and production lines default `nPirmasMat` to 1
(quantity in the product's first unit), like `ProductLine`; pass
`additionalData: ['nPirmasMat' => 0]` to opt out.

### Creating a Production Operation

```php
$result = $finvalda->production()
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->finishedProduct('FINISHED001')
    ->documentNumber('PROD-001')
    ->description('Daily production run')
    ->addFinishedGood('FINISHED001', warehouse: 'MAIN', quantity: 100, amount: 500.00)
    ->addRawMaterial('RAW001', warehouse: 'MAIN', quantity: 200)
    ->addRawMaterial('RAW002', warehouse: 'MAIN', quantity: 50)
    ->addProductionService('SVC001', amount: 100.00, quantity: 1)
    ->save('PRODUCTION');
```

### Non-Analytical Operations

```php
$result = $finvalda->nonAnalytical()
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->documentNumber('DEP-001')
    ->description1('Depreciation entry')
    ->addEntry('6110', 'Equipment depreciation', debitLocal: 500.00, creditLocal: 0)
    ->addEntry('1240', 'Accumulated depreciation', debitLocal: 0, creditLocal: 500.00)
    ->save('JOURNAL');
```

### Inventory Count

```php
$result = $finvalda->inventoryCount()
    ->journal('INVENT')
    ->warehouse('01')
    ->date('2024-03-03')
    ->addItem('B.BENZINAS', quantity: 15.45, account: '1275')
    ->addItem('B.DYZELINAS', quantity: 20.00, account: '1275')
    ->save('INVENTORY');

// mode 1 adds to a count the product already has that day in that warehouse;
// mode 0 (the default) overwrites it. Anything else throws.
$result = $finvalda->inventoryCount()
    ->mode(1)
    ->journal('INVENT')
    ->warehouse('01')
    ->date('2024-03-03')
    ->addItem('B.PROPANAS', quantity: 8.00, account: '1275')
    ->save('INVENTORY');
```

### Clearing / Set-Off

```php
use Finvalda\Enums\ClearingDocumentType;

$result = $finvalda->clearing()
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->name('Monthly clearing')
    ->debtor('CLI001')
    ->creditor('CLI002')
    ->addDebitLine(amount: 270.00, series: 'SF', document: '001', type: ClearingDocumentType::Sale)
    ->addCreditLine(amount: 270.00, series: 'PF', document: '002', type: ClearingDocumentType::Purchase)
    ->save('CLEARING');

// The debit side accepts 1/3/4/6 and the credit side 0/2/5/6 (raw ints still
// work); a type from the wrong side throws ValidationException.

// Using account entries (type 6)
$result = $finvalda->clearing()
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->debtor('CLI001')
    ->creditor('CLI002')
    ->addDebitAccount(amount: 270.00, account: '241000')
    ->addCreditAccount(amount: 270.00, account: '241001')
    ->save('CLEARING');
```

### UVM (Order Management)

```php
// UVM sales reservation (workshop/service order)
$result = $finvalda->uvmSalesReservation()
    ->client('HTNT')
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->documentNumber('30608')
    ->fulfillmentDate('2024-01-20')
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->object1('SERVISAS')
    ->note('Workshop order #30608')
    ->service(ServiceLine::make('5054', 1)->amount(0)->description('Service description'))
    ->save('WORKSHOP');

// UVM purchase order
$result = $finvalda->uvmPurchaseOrder()
    ->client('SUP001')
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->documentNumber('UZS-001')
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->addProduct('PRD001', quantity: 24, amount: 84.00, warehouse: 'CENTR.')
    ->save('ORDER');

// UVM cancellation
$result = $finvalda->uvmCancellation()
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->name('Cancel reservations')
    ->documentNumber('ANUL-001')
    ->addCancellation(journal: 'UVMPARD', number: 123)
    ->addCancellation(journal: 'UVMPARD', number: 124)
    ->save('CANCEL');
```

### Short / Simplified Operations

All sales, purchase, return and UVM reservation/order builders support a `short()` mode that uses the simplified `Trumpas*` variants. Short operations send minimal headers and let the server fill in defaults. A short sales header takes only client, date, series, document, currency, fulfillment date and document type; a short purchase header only client, date, series, document, currency and document type. Any other header field fails at `build()` with `ValidationException`.

```php
// Short sale — server applies default settings
$result = $finvalda->sale()
    ->short()
    ->client('CLI001')
    ->date('2024-01-15')
    ->series('SF')
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->addProduct('PRD001', quantity: 10, amount: 199.90, price: 19.99)
    ->save('STANDARD');

// Short purchase return
$result = $finvalda->purchaseReturn()
    ->short()
    ->client('SUP001')
    ->date('2024-01-20')
    ->currency('EUR')
    ->series('GR')
    ->addProduct('PRD001', quantity: 10, amount: 99.90)
    ->save('RETURN');
```

Builders supporting `short()`: `sale()`, `salesReservation()`, `salesReturn()`, `uvmSalesReservation()` (`TrumpasUVMPardRezDok`), `purchase()`, `purchaseOrder()`, `purchaseReturn()`, `uvmPurchaseOrder()` (`TrumpasUVMPirkUzsDok`).

To delete an operation you created, `OperationClass::deleteClass()` gives the
matching `DeleteOperationClass` (short variants map to their full class), or `null`
where the spec offers no delete.

## Query Builders

Build queries fluently for better readability and IDE support.

### Transaction Query

```php
use Finvalda\Query\TransactionQuery;

// Create a fluent query
$query = TransactionQuery::create()
    ->journal('PARD')
    ->series('AA')
    ->dateRange('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31')
    ->modifiedSince('2024-06-01');

// Use with transactions resource
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->sales($query->toFilter());
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->salesDetail($query->toFilter());

// Query methods
$query = TransactionQuery::create()
    ->journal('PARD')              // Filter by journal code
    ->operationNumber(123)         // Filter by operation number
    ->series('AA')                 // Filter by document series
    ->orderNumber('SF-001')        // Filter by order/document number
    ->journalGroup('SALES_GRP')    // Filter by journal group
    ->dateFrom('2024-01-01')       // Operation date from
    ->dateTo('2024-12-31')         // Operation date to
    ->dateRange('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31')  // Both dates at once
    ->modifiedSince('2024-06-01'); // Only modified since
```

### Operation Query

```php
use Finvalda\Query\OperationQuery;

// Factory methods for common operation types
$query = OperationQuery::sales()
    ->journal('PARD')
    ->dateRange('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31')
    ->client('CLI001');

// Use with operations resource
$response = $finvalda->operations()->query($query);

// All factory methods
$query = OperationQuery::sales();
$query = OperationQuery::salesDetail();
$query = OperationQuery::purchases();
$query = OperationQuery::purchasesDetail();
$query = OperationQuery::inflows();
$query = OperationQuery::inflowsDetail();
$query = OperationQuery::disbursement();
$query = OperationQuery::disbursementDetail();
$query = OperationQuery::internalTransactions();
$query = OperationQuery::internalTransactionsDetail();
$query = OperationQuery::forClass(OpClass::SalesReturns);

// Query methods
$query = OperationQuery::sales()
    ->journal('PARD')
    ->number(123)
    ->series('AA')
    ->client('CLI001')
    ->warehouse('WH01')
    ->product('PRD001')
    ->dateFrom('2024-01-01')
    ->dateTo('2024-12-31')
    ->modifiedSince('2024-06-01')
    ->journalGroup('SALES_GRP')
    ->object1('DEPT01')
    ->object2('PROJ01')
    ->createdSince('2024-01-01')         // DateCreatedFrom
    ->description('Avans*')              // Description; '*' is a wildcard, line: 2-5 for Description2..5
    ->notCreatedByUser('ROBOT')          // NotCreatedByUser
    ->notEditedByUser('ROBOT')           // NotEditedByUser
    ->set('SomeFilter', 'value');        // raw filter escape hatch (exact tag case)

// Clearings and inflows have their own filters
OperationQuery::forClass(OpClass::ClearingOff)->debtorClient('DEB1')->creditorClient('CRE1');
OperationQuery::inflows()->advancePaymentSettled(false);   // only unsettled advances
```

Without `columns()` the server returns every column.

## Validation

Builders and line DTOs check their input against the spec before anything is
sent, and throw `Finvalda\Exceptions\ValidationException` on a field the target
envelope does not define, an out-of-range value (object level, clearing type,
inventory mode, additional-cost slot) or a missing required correction field.
Date strings must be `Y-m-d` (optionally with a time of day); anything else throws
`InvalidArgumentException`.

```php
use Finvalda\Exceptions\ValidationException;

try {
    $finvalda->purchase()->series('PF')->build();   // PirkDok has no sSerija
} catch (ValidationException $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

The standalone `Finvalda\Validation` rule set was removed: nothing in the SDK used
it. For per-field lengths see the [Field Reference](#field-reference).

## Field Reference

The API enforces per-field **maximum text lengths** and **numeric precision**, and
marks each field as mandatory or auto-filled from the server parameter profile. This is
documented exhaustively in the official spec, which is included in this repo:

**→ [`docs/FVS_Webservice.md`](docs/FVS_Webservice.md)** (the single source of truth)

Look up the write payload you're building:

- **Master data** (`InsertNewItem`) — `Fvs.Preke` (products), `Fvs.Paslauga`
  (services), `Fvs.Klientas` (clients), objects, banks, warehouses, types/tags.
- **Operations** (`InsertNewOperation` / `UpdateOperation`) — `PardDok` (sales),
  `PirkDok` (purchases), `IplDok`/`IsmDok` (payments), `VidPerkDok` (transfers),
  `NurasymasDok`/`PajamavimasDok` (write-off/capitalization), `GamybaDok` (production),
  `UzskaitaDok` (clearing), `KtNeanalitDok` (non-analytical), UVM, and their `*DetEil`
  detail lines.

Each field is a table row with these columns: **type · field name · description · max
length · required · auto-filled-from-parameter · notes**. A `+` in the *required* column
means mandatory; a `+` in the *auto-filled* column means the webservice supplies it from
the parameter profile when omitted. For example, client `sKodas` is `String` max **15**,
required; `sPavadinimas` max **100**; `sEMail` max **30**, optional. Money amounts are
`Numeric (14,2)`.

## Resources

All read methods return a `Response` object:

```php
$response = $finvalda->clients()->list();

$response->successful();  // bool - whether the request succeeded
$response->failed();      // bool - whether the request failed
$response->data;          // array - the response data
$response->error;         // ?string - error message if failed
$response->raw;           // array - full raw response
```

All write methods return an `OperationResult` object:

```php
$result = $finvalda->clients()->create($data);

$result->success;     // bool
$result->series;      // ?string
$result->document;    // ?string
$result->journal;     // ?string
$result->number;      // ?int
$result->error;       // ?string
$result->errorCode;   // ?int
```

### Stock / Inventory

```php
// Current stock balances
$response = $finvalda->stock()->balances();
$response = $finvalda->stock()->balances(productCode: 'PROD001', warehouseCode: 'WH01');

// Extended balances (includes product type, tags)
$response = $finvalda->stock()->balancesExtended();

// Balances with selling prices
$response = $finvalda->stock()->balancesWithPrices(includeZeroQuantity: true);

// Balances by warehouse group
$response = $finvalda->stock()->balancesByGroup(warehouseGroupCode: 'GROUP1');

// Ordered products
$response = $finvalda->stock()->orderedProducts();
```

#### Which purchase operation holds this stock?

For serialised, quantity-1 stock (a VIN, a serial number), `purchaseOpFor()` answers
two questions that otherwise get re-derived by every caller: *which purchase
operation currently holds it*, and *has it been sold since*. Both come from
`GetPrekesIstorija`.

```php
$op = $finvalda->stock()->purchaseOpFor('WSM000001TB061527');

if ($op === null) {
    // never purchased, or the history call failed
} elseif ($op['sold']) {
    // sold on $op['sale_date'] via $op['sale_journal'] #$op['sale_op_number']
} else {
    // current layer: $op['journal'] #$op['op_number'], warehouse $op['warehouse']
}
```

```php
[
    'journal' => 'PIRKNAU', 'op_number' => 1421, 'warehouse' => 'WH01',
    'op_date' => '2026-07-01',
    'sold' => true, 'sale_journal' => 'PARD1', 'sale_op_number' => 77,
    'sale_date' => '2026-07-20',   // sale_* are null when sold is false
]
```

- **The latest purchase wins.** A re-acquired item has several purchase rows; only
  the most recent one holds the current stock layer.
- **A sale counts only when dated at or after that purchase.** An older sale belongs
  to a previous ownership cycle (bought → sold → bought back).
- Unlike the rest of this resource it returns a **plain array, not a `Response`** —
  it exists to be used as a pre-flight check (see
  [Correcting a Purchase](#correcting-a-purchase)). `null` means no purchase history
  or a failed call. Use `products()->history()` for the raw rows.
- Operation kinds are matched on the literal strings `Pirkimai`/`Pardavimai` in
  `op_rusis_pav`. The spec documents the column but never enumerates its values, so
  these are **observed against a live Finvalda, not specified**; an unrecognised kind
  is ignored rather than guessed at. Those labels are Lithuanian, so on a client
  configured with `Language::English` the method **throws** rather than return a
  `null` that would read as "no purchase history".
- **Only a sale counts as consumption.** A write-off, purchase return or internal
  transfer after the purchase leaves `sold` false, and `warehouse` is the purchase
  row's warehouse even if the stock has been moved since.

### Clients

```php
use Finvalda\Enums\ClientTypeId;

// List / find / collect
$response = $finvalda->clients()->list();
$response = $finvalda->clients()->list(modifiedSince: '2024-01-01');
$response = $finvalda->clients()->get('CLIENT001');
$client = $finvalda->clients()->find('CLIENT001');      // Returns typed Client DTO
$clients = $finvalda->clients()->collect();             // Returns ClientCollection

// All clients (with optional date filters)
$response = $finvalda->clients()->all();
$response = $finvalda->clients()->all(modifiedSince: '2024-01-01');

// Find client by email
$response = $finvalda->clients()->findByEmail('client@example.com');

// Client types and tags — see "Types and tags" below for how this works
$types = $finvalda->clients()->typesAndTags(ClientTypeId::Type);     // TypeTagCollection of client types
$tag1  = $finvalda->clients()->typesAndTags(ClientTypeId::Tag1);     // Tag 1 options
$all   = $finvalda->clients()->allTypesAndTags();                    // whole dictionary in one call

// Clients by type
$response = $finvalda->clients()->byType('VIP');

// Accounts (with full filter support)
$response = $finvalda->clients()->accounts(clientCode: 'CLIENT001');
$response = $finvalda->clients()->accounts(
    clientCode: 'CLIENT001',
    journalGroup: 'PARD',
    debtType: 1,
    documentDateFrom: '2024-01-01',
    documentDateTo: '2024-12-31',
);

// Unpaid documents (sales and purchases)
$response = $finvalda->clients()->unpaidDocuments('CLIENT001');
$response = $finvalda->clients()->unpaidPurchaseDocuments('CLIENT001');

// Client debt condition
$response = $finvalda->clients()->debtCondition('CLIENT001', journalGroup: 'PARD');

// Settlements
$response = $finvalda->clients()->settlements(series: 'SER', document: 'DOC001');
$response = $finvalda->clients()->settlements(journal: 'PARD', number: 123);
$response = $finvalda->clients()->settlementsDetailed(series: 'SER', document: 'DOC001');
$response = $finvalda->clients()->settlementsFromDate(series: 'SER', modifiedSince: '2024-01-01');
$response = $finvalda->clients()->settlementsFromDateParam($xmlParam); // raw XML param variant

// CRUD operations
$result = $finvalda->clients()->create([
    'sKodas' => 'NEW001',
    'sPavadinimas' => 'New Client Ltd',
    'sDebtSask' => '2410',
    'sKredSask' => '5001',
]);

$result = $finvalda->clients()->update([
    'sKodas' => 'NEW001',
    'sPavadinimas' => 'Updated Client Name',
]);

$result = $finvalda->clients()->delete('CLIENT001');

// Invoices related to a customer
$response = $finvalda->clients()->invoicesRelatedToCustomer('CLIENT001', debtType: 0);
```

Countries are maintained in Finvalda by hand — the web service cannot create or list them — so a client card whose `sValstybeKodas` names a country missing there fails with `Country 'XX' not found!`.

### Products

```php
use Finvalda\Enums\ProductTypeId;

// List / find / collect
$response = $finvalda->products()->list();
$response = $finvalda->products()->get('PROD001');
$product = $finvalda->products()->find('PROD001');      // Returns typed Product DTO
$products = $finvalda->products()->collect();           // Returns ProductCollection

// Extended list with filters
$response = $finvalda->products()->listExtended(
    type: 'ELECTRONICS',
    supplier1: 'SUPP01',
    modifiedSince: '2024-01-01',
);

// All products
$response = $finvalda->products()->all(modifiedSince: '2024-01-01');

// Product image (envelope with base64 `fileContents`)
$response = $finvalda->products()->image('PROD001');

// Product image as decoded JPG bytes
$jpg = $finvalda->products()->imageJpeg('PROD001');

// Products in warehouse
$response = $finvalda->products()->inWarehouse('WH01', modifiedSince: '2024-01-01');
$response = $finvalda->products()->inWarehouseOrdered('WH01', order: 1);

// Types and tags — see "Types and tags" below for how this works
$types = $finvalda->products()->typesAndTags(ProductTypeId::Type);    // TypeTagCollection of product types
$tag1  = $finvalda->products()->typesAndTags(ProductTypeId::Tag1);    // Tag 1 options
$all   = $finvalda->products()->allTypesAndTags();                    // whole dictionary in one call
$response = $finvalda->products()->typeGroups();
$response = $finvalda->products()->typeGroupComposition('GRP01');
$response = $finvalda->products()->byType('ELECTRONICS');

// Product history
$response = $finvalda->products()->history('PROD001', dateFrom: '2024-01-01');

// Sold products per period
$response = $finvalda->products()->soldPerPeriod(
    productCode: 'PROD001',
    warehouseCode: 'WH01',
    dateFrom: '2024-01-01',
    dateTo: '2024-12-31',
);

// CRUD operations
$result = $finvalda->products()->create([
    'sKodas' => 'NEWPROD',
    'sPavadinimas' => 'New Product',
    'sRysysSuSask' => '2414',
    'sMatavimoVnt' => 'vnt',
]);

$result = $finvalda->products()->update([
    'sKodas' => 'PROD001',
    'sPavadinimas' => 'Updated Product Name',
]);

// Bulk edit product properties (applies to multiple products at once)
$result = $finvalda->products()->editProperties([
    'Kodas' => ['PROD001', 'PROD002', 'PROD003'],
    'pardKaina1' => '19.99',
    'pardVal' => 'EUR',
]);

$result = $finvalda->products()->delete('PROD001');
```

### Services

```php
use Finvalda\Enums\ServiceTypeId;

// List / find / collect
$response = $finvalda->services()->list();
$response = $finvalda->services()->get('SVC001');
$service = $finvalda->services()->find('SVC001');       // Returns typed Service DTO
$services = $finvalda->services()->collect();           // Returns ServiceCollection

// All services
$response = $finvalda->services()->all(modifiedSince: '2024-01-01');

// Types and tags — see "Types and tags" below for how this works
$types = $finvalda->services()->typesAndTags(ServiceTypeId::Type);    // TypeTagCollection of service types
$tag1  = $finvalda->services()->typesAndTags(ServiceTypeId::Tag1);    // Tag 1 options
$all   = $finvalda->services()->allTypesAndTags();                    // whole dictionary in one call
$response = $finvalda->services()->byType('CONSULTING');

// CRUD operations
$result = $finvalda->services()->create([
    'sKodas' => 'NEWSVC',
    'sPavadinimas' => 'New Service',
    'sRysysSuSask' => '5001',
]);

$result = $finvalda->services()->update(['sKodas' => 'SVC001', 'sPavadinimas' => 'Updated']);
$result = $finvalda->services()->delete('SVC001');
```

### Types and tags (rūšys ir požymiai)

Products, clients and services each have a "type" (rūšis) plus a number of "tag"
groups (požymiai). Finvalda exposes them through one endpoint per entity:

| Entity   | Endpoint                  | Accessor                          |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Products | `GetPrekiuRusisPozymius`  | `$finvalda->products()`           |
| Clients  | `GetKlientuRusisPozymius` | `$finvalda->clients()`            |
| Services | `GetPaslauguRusisPozymius`| `$finvalda->services()`           |

**One call returns the whole dictionary.** Each endpoint returns *every* type and
*every* tag group in a single response. The rows are discriminated by a `tipas`
column. The legacy `nID` request parameter is **ignored by the server** — passing
different values returns byte-identical results — so the SDK does not send it and
filters by `tipas` client-side instead.

**`tipas` → field mapping** (note the non-sequential numbering for clients/services):

| Entity   | Type | Tag1 | Tag2 | Tag3 | Tag4 | Tag5 | Tag6 | Tag9 | Tag10 | Tag11 |
|----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|-------|
| Products | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 9    | 10    | 11    |
| Clients  | 22   | 12   | 13   | 14   | —    | —    | —    | —    | —     | —     |
| Services | 18   | 15   | 16   | 17   | —    | —    | —    | —    | —     | —     |

These integers are the `ProductTypeId` / `ClientTypeId` / `ServiceTypeId` enum
values. Servers may define additional `tipas` values that have no enum case — for
example products often expose `tipas = 100` ("Apmokestinamieji gaminiai"). Pass
those as a raw int. A tag group the server has not configured simply yields an
empty collection; that is normal and not an error.

**Returned columns** (mapped onto the `TypeTag` DTO):

| Column        | DTO property | Notes                        |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| `tipas`       | `->tipas`    | int discriminator (see above)|
| `kodas`       | `->code`     | the code you reference        |
| `pavadinimas` | `->name`     | display name                  |
| `info1`       | `->info1`    | products only                 |
| `info2`       | `->info2`    | products only                 |

```php
use Finvalda\Enums\ProductTypeId;

// A single type/tag group, filtered by tipas → TypeTagCollection of TypeTag
$types = $finvalda->products()->typesAndTags(ProductTypeId::Type);
foreach ($types as $t) {
    echo "{$t->code}: {$t->name}\n";   // ->tipas, ->code, ->name, ->info1, ->info2
}

// Raw int works for server-defined tipas without an enum case
$taxable = $finvalda->products()->typesAndTags(100);

// The WHOLE dictionary in ONE HTTP call (cached on the resource instance)
$all = $finvalda->products()->allTypesAndTags();          // TypeTagCollection (every row)
$byTipas = $all->groupByType();                           // array<int, TypeTagCollection>
$tag1Values = $byTipas[1] ?? new \Finvalda\Collections\TypeTagCollection();
$present = $all->types();                                 // distinct tipas values present
```

`typesAndTags()` and `allTypesAndTags()` share a single cached request, so calling
both (or several filtered reads) on the same resource instance does **not** fan out
into multiple round-trips.

**Creating, updating and deleting types and tags.** The dictionary read above is
read-only; manage entries via `References` (create/update/delete for product and
client types and tags — see the [Reference Data](#reference-data) section):

```php
// Create a product type (Fvs.PrekesRusis) and a Tag-N value (Fvs.PrekesPoz{N}, N = 1..20)
$finvalda->references()->createProductType(['sKodas' => 'ELECTRONICS', 'sPavadinimas' => 'Electronics']);
$finvalda->references()->createProductTag(1, ['sKodas' => 'PROMO', 'sPavadinimas' => 'Promotional']);
$finvalda->references()->updateProductTag(1, ['sKodas' => 'PROMO', 'sPavadinimas' => 'Promo 2026']);
$finvalda->references()->deleteProductTag(1, 'PROMO');
// Clients: createClientType()/createClientTag(1..3) (Fvs.KlientoRusis / Fvs.Kliento{I|II|III}Poz),
// plus update*/delete* counterparts. Service types/tags are read-only (no API write class).
```

The `kodas` returned by `typesAndTags()` is exactly what you pass into
`Products::create()` as `sRusis` (type) and `sPozymis1..N` (tags):

```php
$finvalda->products()->create([
    'sKodas'      => 'NEWPROD',
    'sPavadinimas'=> 'New Product',
    'sRusis'      => 'ELECTRONICS',   // a Type kodas (tipas 0)
    'sPozymis1'   => 'PROMO',         // a Tag1 kodas (tipas 1)
]);
```

### Objects (6 Levels)

```php
// List objects at level 1-6
$response = $finvalda->objects()->list(level: 1);
$response = $finvalda->objects()->list(level: 2, objectCode: 'OBJ001');

// Get single object
$response = $finvalda->objects()->get(level: 1, objectCode: 'OBJ001');

// Create / update
$result = $finvalda->objects()->create(level: 1, data: [
    'sKodas' => 'DEPT01',
    'sPavadinimas' => 'Sales Department',
]);

$result = $finvalda->objects()->update(level: 1, data: [
    'sKodas' => 'DEPT01',
    'sPavadinimas' => 'Updated Department',
]);
```

### Transactions (Financial Detail Data)

```php
use Finvalda\Filters\TransactionFilter;
use Finvalda\Filters\PaymentFilter;
use Finvalda\Query\TransactionQuery;

// Using filter DTO
$filter = new TransactionFilter(
    dateFrom: '2024-01-01',
    dateTo: '2024-12-31',
    journalGroup: 'PARD_GRP',
);

// Or using fluent query builder
$filter = TransactionQuery::create()
    ->dateRange('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31')
    ->journalGroup('PARD_GRP')
    ->toFilter();

// Sales
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->sales($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->salesDetail($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->salesDetailWithPrimeCost($filter);

// Sale Reservations
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->saleReservations($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->saleReservationsDetail($filter);

// Sales Returns
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->salesReturns($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->salesReturnsDetail($filter);

// Purchases
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->purchases($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->purchasesDetail($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->purchasesExtendedDetail($filter);

// Purchase Orders & Returns
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->purchaseOrders($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->purchaseOrdersDetail($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->purchaseReturns($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->purchaseReturnsDetail($filter);

// Inflows with payment reference
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->inflowsDetail(
    filter: $filter,
    paymentFilter: new PaymentFilter(
        payedForDocSeries: 'AA',
        payedForDocOrderNumber: 'SF-001',
    ),
);

// Advance Payments
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->advancedPaymentsDetail(
    filter: $filter,
    client: 'CLIENT001',
    offsetStatus: 0,
);

// Disbursements & Clearing
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->disbursementsDetail($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->clearingOffsDetail($filter);

// OMM (Order Management Module)
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->ommSales($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->ommSalesDetail($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->ommPurchases($filter);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->ommPurchasesDetail($filter);

// OMM sales filtered by a raw XML condition
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->ommSalesXmlCondition($xmlData);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->ommSalesXmlConditionWithTitle($xmlData);

// Advance payments (extended)
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->advancedPaymentsDetailExtended(
    filter: $filter,
    client: 'CLIENT001',
    offsetStatus: 0,
);

// Fixed Assets & Currency
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->depreciationOfFixedAssets(year: 2024, month: 6);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->depreciationOfFixedAssetsObjects(year: 2024, month: 6);
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->currencyDebtRecount($filter);

// Low Value Inventory
$response = $finvalda->transactions()->lowValueInventory();
```

### Operations (Create, Update, Delete)

Operations require a `$parameter` argument which is server-configured. See [Server-Configured Parameters](#server-configured-parameters).

```php
use Finvalda\Enums\OperationClass;
use Finvalda\Enums\DeleteOperationClass;
use Finvalda\Enums\UpdateOperationClass;
use Finvalda\Enums\OpClass;
use Finvalda\Query\OperationQuery;

$parameter = 'STANDARD'; // Server-configured

// Create operations (prefer fluent builders - see above)
$result = $finvalda->operations()->create(OperationClass::Sale, $data, $parameter);
$result = $finvalda->operations()->create(OperationClass::Purchase, $data, $parameter);
$result = $finvalda->operations()->create(OperationClass::InternalTransfer, $data, $parameter);

// Delete an operation
$result = $finvalda->operations()->delete(
    DeleteOperationClass::Sale,
    journal: 'PARD',
    number: 123,
    parameter: $parameter,
);

// Update an operation
$result = $finvalda->operations()->update(UpdateOperationClass::Sale, [
    'sZurnalas' => 'PARD',
    'nNumeris' => 123,
    'PardDokHeadEil' => ['sPastaba' => 'Updated comment'],
], $parameter);

// Read operations with query builder
$query = OperationQuery::sales()
    ->dateRange('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31')
    ->client('CLIENT001');

$response = $finvalda->operations()->query($query->opClass(), $query->build());

// Or with arrays (sent as opReadParams, filter keys must be nested under `filter`)
$response = $finvalda->operations()->get(OpClass::Sales, [
    'filter' => [
        'OpDateFrom' => '2024-01-01',
        'OpDateTill' => '2024-12-31',
    ],
]);

// Lock / unlock operations
$finvalda->operations()->lock('PARD', 123, parameter: 'STANDARD');
$finvalda->operations()->unlock('PARD', 123);
$finvalda->operations()->unlock('PARD', 123, newJournal: 'PARD2'); // move to new journal on unlock
$response = $finvalda->operations()->isLocked('PARD', 123);

// Change journal
$result = $finvalda->operations()->changeJournal([
    'sJournal' => 'PARD',
    'nOpNumber' => 123,
    'sJournalNew' => 'PARD2',
]);

// Copy operation
$result = $finvalda->operations()->copy([
    'sParameter' => 'STANDARD',
    'sJournal' => 'PARD',
    'nOpNumber' => 123,
    'sJournalNew' => 'PARD2',
    'bDeleteSourceOp' => false,
    'bKeepDocument' => false,
]);

// Activity by analytical objects (GetVeiklaPagalObjektus)
$response = $finvalda->operations()->activityByObjects([
    'tDataNuo' => '2024-01-01',
    'tDataIki' => '2024-12-31',
    // ...object/journal filters
]);
```

### Order Management (UVM)

```php
$response = $finvalda->orderManagement()->salesReservationStatus('PARD', 123);

$response = $finvalda->orderManagement()->completedReservations(
    journalGroup: 'PARD_GRP',
    dateFrom: '2024-01-01',
    dateTo: '2024-12-31',
);
$response = $finvalda->orderManagement()->pendingReservations();
$response = $finvalda->orderManagement()->cancelledReservations();
$response = $finvalda->orderManagement()->orderedProducts(dateFrom: '2024-01-01');
```

### Pricing & Discounts

```php
// Combined client + item prices. These endpoints take NO client or item
// filter — they return the whole matrix, so narrow the rows yourself.
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->clientItemPrices();
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->clientTypeItemPrices(modifiedSince: '2024-01-01');
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->clientItemTypePrices();
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->clientTypeItemTypePrices();

// Product discounts and additional prices
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->clientProductDiscounts('CLI001');
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->clientProductAdditionalPrices('CLI001');
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->clientProductTypeDiscounts('CLI001');

// Service pricing
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->clientServiceDiscounts('CLI001');
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->clientServiceAdditionalPrices('CLI001');

// Client type pricing
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->clientTypeProductDiscounts('VIP');
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->clientTypeServiceDiscounts('VIP');

// The full pricing matrix follows a consistent naming scheme:
//   client[Type]  ×  Product|Service[Type]  ×  Discounts|AdditionalPrices
// All of the following are available (each takes the relevant code plus
// optional modifiedSince / createdSince date filters):
$finvalda->pricing()->clientProductTypeAdditionalPrices('CLI001');
$finvalda->pricing()->clientServiceTypeDiscounts('CLI001');
$finvalda->pricing()->clientServiceTypeAdditionalPrices('CLI001');
$finvalda->pricing()->clientTypeProductAdditionalPrices('VIP');
$finvalda->pricing()->clientTypeProductTypeDiscounts('VIP');
$finvalda->pricing()->clientTypeProductTypeAdditionalPrices('VIP');
$finvalda->pricing()->clientTypeServiceAdditionalPrices('VIP');
$finvalda->pricing()->clientTypeServiceTypeDiscounts('VIP');
$finvalda->pricing()->clientTypeServiceTypeAdditionalPrices('VIP');

// Recommended price calculation
$response = $finvalda->pricing()->recommendedPrice([
    'invoiceType' => 0,
    'invoiceDate' => ['year' => 2024, 'month' => 6, 'day' => 15],
    'itemType' => 1,
    'itemCode' => 'PROD001',
    'itemAmount' => 10,
    'warehouseCode' => 'WH01',
    'clientCode' => 'CLI001',
]);
```

### Documents

```php
use Finvalda\Enums\DocumentEntityType;

// Upload (InsertDocument) — content travels hex-encoded
$result = $finvalda->documents()->uploadFile('invoice.pdf', '/path/to/invoice.pdf');
$result = $finvalda->documents()->upload('doc.pdf', $hexContent, description: 'Signed copy', finUser: 'ADMIN');

// Attach to an entity: a description by its code, an operation by journal + number
$result = $finvalda->documents()->attach(DocumentEntityType::Client, 'CLI001', 'invoice.pdf');
$result = $finvalda->documents()->attach(DocumentEntityType::Sale, 'PARD', 'invoice.pdf', 123);

// Documents attached to one entity; files arrive hex-encoded under
// $response->raw['result']['enitityDocs'][n]['docs'][m] as {name, data}
$response = $finvalda->documents()->attached(DocumentEntityType::Sale, 'PARD', 123);

// Delete
$result = $finvalda->documents()->delete('invoice.pdf');
```

### Reports & Invoices

```php
// Recommended: pass params as an array and get decoded PDF bytes back
$pdf = $finvalda->reports()->makeInvoicePdf([
    'FakturosKodas' => 'PARD_01',
    'sSerija' => 'AAA',

$response = $finvalda->reports()->autoReports();
$response = $finvalda->reports()->autoReport('report_filename.pdf');
$pdf = $finvalda->reports()->autoReportPdf('report_filename.pdf');
```

### Descriptions (Universal Query)

```php
use Finvalda\Enums\DescriptionType;

// The SDK nests filters under the correct key per description type. Pass only
// the inner filter contents; the wrapping (StockOnDate, Products, Series, ...)
// is handled for you.
$response = $finvalda->descriptions()->get(DescriptionType::Products, [
    'Codes' => ['PROD001', 'PROD002'],
], page: 1, limit: 50);

// Convenience methods

// Address cards take two filter objects: Clients and Address
$response = $finvalda->descriptions()->addresses(
    clients: ['Codes' => ['CLI001']],
    addresses: ['Codes' => ['SAN1'], 'Tag1' => 'X'],
);

// Any extra readParams key (merged last) for shapes the helpers don't cover
$response = $finvalda->descriptions()->get(DescriptionType::Address, ['Codes' => ['CLI001']], readParams: [

$response = $finvalda->descriptions()->get(DescriptionType::PartnerProducts, [
    'Codes' => ['PROD001'],
    'Client' => 'CLI001',

$result = $finvalda->references()->updatePaymentTerm(['sKodas' => 'NET30', 'sPavadinimas' => 'Net 30 days']);

// Append an item to a group (AppendGroup)
$result = $finvalda->references()->addToGroup(
    itemClassName: 'Fvs.Preke',
    groupCode: 'GRP01',
    itemCode: 'PROD001',

```

### User Permissions

```php
$response = $finvalda->permissions()->warehouses();
$response = $finvalda->permissions()->clients();
$response = $finvalda->permissions()->operationTypes();
$response = $finvalda->permissions()->operationJournals();
```

## Pagination

For large datasets, use lazy pagination with the `Cursor` class:

```php
use Finvalda\Pagination\Cursor;
use Finvalda\Pagination\LazyCollection;

// Create a cursor for clients
$cursor = new Cursor(
    fetcher: fn($modifiedSince, $createdSince) =>
        $finvalda->clients()->all($modifiedSince, $createdSince)->data,
    dateExtractor: fn($item) => isset($item['tKoregavimoData'])
        ? new \DateTime($item['tKoregavimoData'])
        : null,
    // Recommended: a stable identity per record so duplicates from
    // overlapping date ranges are skipped reliably. Without it, items
    // are compared by full content.
    idExtractor: fn($item) => $item['sKodas'],
);

// Iterate lazily (memory efficient)
foreach ($cursor->modifiedSince('2024-01-01')->getIterator() as $clientData) {
    echo $clientData['sPavadinimas'] . "\n";
}

// Take first N items
$first100 = $cursor->take(100);

// Get all as array
$allClients = $cursor->all();

// LazyCollection for generator-based iteration
$lazy = LazyCollection::make($finvalda->clients()->all()->data);

$filtered = $lazy
    ->filter(fn($c) => ($c['dSkola'] ?? 0) > 0)
    ->map(fn($c) => $c['sPavadinimas'])
    ->take(10)
    ->all();
```

## Error Handling

```php
use Finvalda\Exceptions\FinvaldaException;
use Finvalda\Exceptions\AccessDeniedException;
use Finvalda\Exceptions\ValidationException;
use Finvalda\Exceptions\NotFoundException;
use Finvalda\Exceptions\NetworkException;
use Finvalda\Exceptions\ServerException;
use Finvalda\Exceptions\HttpException;
use Finvalda\Exceptions\OperationFailedException;

try {
    $client = $finvalda->clients()->find('CLI001');
} catch (NotFoundException $e) {
    echo "Client not found";
} catch (AccessDeniedException $e) {
    echo "Access denied: {$e->getMessage()}";
} catch (NetworkException $e) {
    echo "Network error (connection failed, timeout): {$e->getMessage()}";
} catch (ServerException $e) {
    echo "Server error ({$e->getCode()}): {$e->getMessage()}";
} catch (HttpException $e) {
    echo "HTTP error ({$e->getCode()}): {$e->getMessage()}";   // other 4xx; $e->response holds the response
} catch (ValidationException $e) {
    echo "Invalid input: {$e->getMessage()}";
} catch (FinvaldaException $e) {
    echo "API error: {$e->getMessage()}";
}

// Check response status
$response = $finvalda->clients()->list();

if ($response->failed()) {
    echo "Error: {$response->error}";
}

// Check operation result
$result = $finvalda->clients()->create($data);

if ($result->success) {
    echo "Created: {$result->journal} #{$result->number}";
} else {
    echo "Error #{$result->errorCode}: {$result->error}";
}

// Or let a failure throw: Response::throw() raises FinvaldaException,
// OperationResult::throw() raises OperationFailedException (errorCode, journal, number).
$data = $finvalda->clients()->list()->throw()->data;

try {
    $result = $finvalda->clients()->create($data)->throw();
} catch (OperationFailedException $e) {
    echo "Error #{$e->errorCode}: {$e->getMessage()}";
}
```

An exception's message never carries a credential: Guzzle embeds the request URI in its
own messages (and `GetFvsUser` sends `sPassword` in the query), so the SDK scrubs those
values and does not chain Guzzle's exception as `previous`. With a retry policy, the
exception thrown after the last attempt is the same `NetworkException`/`ServerException`
you get without one.

## Server-Configured Parameters

Finvalda uses server-configured parameters that depend on your installation.

### sParametras (Operations)

Required for operation methods (`create`, `update`, `delete`). Tells the server which journal configuration to use.

```php
$parameter = 'STANDARD'; // Your server-configured value

$result = $finvalda->operations()->create(OperationClass::Sale, $data, $parameter);
$result = $finvalda->sale()->client('CLI001')->addProduct('PRD001', 10, 19.99)->save($parameter);
```

> **Deeper reference — [`docs/parameters/`](docs/parameters/):** explains what a
> `sParametras` profile actually contains (journal, operation type, series, document type,
> accounts, VAT, division, employee, Intrastat data, flags), how it is configured in the
> `FvsNETParamKonfig` tool, and a YAML format
> ([`parameters.example.yaml`](docs/parameters/parameters.example.yaml)) for cataloguing your
> own profiles. With that catalog filled in, an AI assistant can match a transaction to the
> right profile, explain a profile, or draft `FvsNETParamKonfig` setup instructions for a new
> one. Keep deployment-specific values out of version control (the catalog file is
> git-ignored).

### sFvsImportoParametras (Items)

Optional data field for item methods. Include in data array if required:

```php
$result = $finvalda->clients()->create([

]);
```

### Troubleshooting Parameter Errors

If you receive an error like:

```json
{
  "nResult": 1036,
  "sError": "Parameter 'NET_DELSPINIGIAI_SUPVM' not found in database!"
}
```

This means the parameter is not configured on your server. Contact your Finvalda administrator for valid parameter values.

## API Versions

This SDK targets **V2 (FvsServicePure)** - the recommended REST interface.

| Version | URL Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| V2 (recommended) | `.../FvsServicePure.svc` | Clean REST JSON/XML |
| V1 | `.../FvsServiceR.svc/rest` | REST with string-wrapped responses |
| V0 | `.../FvsService.asmx` | SOAP + REST XML |

## Keeping Up to Date

The SDK is built from the [official Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7208231/2s8YmRMLvd). To check for new endpoints:

```bash
bin/sync-postman-collection
```

> **Note on parameter names.** The legacy method signatures in `docs/FVS_Webservice.txt`
> describe the older V0 (SOAP) interface and do **not** always match the V2
> `FvsServicePure` endpoint this SDK targets. For example, `GetPrekesSandelyje`
> is documented with `sSanKod` but the V2 endpoint actually honors `sSandKod`
> (verified against a live server). When a query filter appears to be silently
> ignored, confirm the exact parameter name against a live server rather than
> trusting the `.txt` signature.
